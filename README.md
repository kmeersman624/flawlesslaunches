## Challenges

Kate had some issues to getting PHP to correctly install on her older PC which took some extra time. Once this was installed, it was easy to get email on contact form up and running when user clicks send message.

## Future Development

- We hope to work togeth with Dr. Maass in the future to possibly add access to spreadsheets and templates discussed in book.
- We also hope to work with Dr. Maass on another site for his full consulting busienss that will include all publications, trainings and classes offered by Dr. Maass, in addition to his consulting business.
